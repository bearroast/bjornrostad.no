    <p>Banquet partnered with the top wine merchants in America and built tools that make it very easy and efficient to merchandise wine, sell online and make sure the inventory is always up to date. We started by designing a dashboard that parse through spreadsheets and organizes a store‘s wine inventory intelligently with tags and information from Delectable.</p>

        <p>Products are automatically merchandised with tags, ratings, tasting notes, photos and more. There‘s no work involved for the merchant other than fulfilling orders.</p>

        <p>Keeping stores updated on deliveries and shipment notifications is important. We integrated Postmates with Google Maps and stores receives alerts when new orders come in.</p>

        <p>Customers can download an app and shop their favorite store from home. They can choose to pick up the wine at the store, have wines delivered with Postmates or standard USPS/FedEx/UPS shipping options set up by the store.</p>
        <p>People pick a store near them or find a store with the product they‘re looking for. The home tab is customized by the store from the dashboard. Search lists all products available with sorting options and filters. Changing stores and checking order status is easily accessed from the side menu.</p>

        <p>The app is universal for iPhone and iPad. Products on iPad are displayed in a modal to make it quick to go through multiple wines.</p>

        <p>I designed a product page and checkout flow on web that displays all the wine information from the dashbaord. The benefit of web is that people don‘t have to download an app to purchase anything. It dramatically improved sales for retailers as the product pages started showing up in Google when people searched online for wine.</p>
