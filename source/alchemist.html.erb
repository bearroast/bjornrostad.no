      <h1>Alchemist Cocktails</h1>
      <p>I love mixing, drinking and creating cocktails. For fun after work and during weekends I learned Swift and Xcode. Alchemist is the first app I‘ve built myself. I plan on releasing it on the the App Store soon.</p>

    <p>I have a lot of ideas around the app and a couple of features I‘d like to focus on for the first release. The core problems I‘d like to solve with the app.</p>
    <p>It should be easy to find recipes based on the ingredients you have in your bar. Going through cocktail books is time consuming and you never find the recipe that works with the ingredients you have.</p>
