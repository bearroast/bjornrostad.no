        <h1>Delectable Wine</h1>
        <p>The world of wine used to be opaque and difficult to understand. We wanted to change that. We built Delectable — a community of wine drinkers, industry experts and sommeliers.</p>

        <p>Wine is complex, and buying wine is even more difficult. So we democratized the industry by letting both wine enthusiasts and experts write and share their tasting notes, and consolidating their reviews in one place. It was a lot of fun to design a product that is useful to both casual wine drinkers and industry experts, who work with wine fulltime as wine makers, journalists and sommeliers at the world‘s top restaurants.</p>
